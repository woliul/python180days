# 🔢 Problem: The 3n + 1 [Problem](https://onlinejudge.org/external/1/100.pdf)

In computer science, there exists a simple algorithm known as the **Collatz conjecture**, which has an interesting behavior for any positive integer. Despite its simplicity, the behavior of this algorithm has not been fully proven for all integers.

#### The Algorithm:

Given an integer `n`, repeat the following steps:

1. Print `n`.
2. If `n == 1`, stop.
3. If `n` is **odd**, set `n = 3 * n + 1`.
4. If `n` is **even**, set `n = n / 2`.
5. Repeat from step 1.

For example, starting with `n = 22`, the sequence is:

```
22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
```

This sequence has **16** terms. This count is called the **cycle length** of the number.

#### Your Task:

Given two integers `i` and `j`, find the **maximum cycle length** among all numbers between `i` and `j`, inclusive.

### 📥 Input:

A series of lines, each containing two integers `i` and `j` where:

* `1 ≤ i, j < 10,000`

### 📤 Output:

For each input pair `i j`, print three values on one line:

```
i j max_cycle_length
```

Where `max_cycle_length` is the maximum cycle length for integers between `i` and `j` (inclusive). Preserve the original order of `i` and `j` in the output.

### ✅ Example

**Input:**

```
1 10
100 200
201 210
900 1000
```

**Output:**

```
1 10 20
100 200 125
201 210 89
900 1000 174
```

# 🛠️ Solutions

## 🧩 **Problem Overview – The 3n + 1 Problem**

This problem is based on the **Collatz Conjecture**, an unsolved mathematical problem. The rule is simple:

Given a number `n`, repeat the following steps:

1. If `n` is **1**, stop.
2. If `n` is **even**, divide it by 2 (`n = n / 2`).
3. If `n` is **odd**, multiply by 3 and add 1 (`n = 3n + 1`).
4. Repeat the steps until you reach 1.

For example, if we start with `n = 22`, the sequence is:

```
22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
```

This has **16 steps**, so we say the **cycle length of 22 is 16**.



## 📥 **Input Explanation**

You are given **multiple lines** of input.
Each line contains **two integers** `i` and `j` (e.g., `1 10`, `100 200`).

* These represent a **range of numbers**, from `i` to `j` inclusive.
* Input continues until end-of-file (EOF).

💡 Both `i` and `j` will always be between **1 and 9,999**.



## 📤 **Output Explanation**

For each input pair `i j`, your program should:

1. Consider **all numbers between i and j**, inclusive.
2. For each number in that range, compute its **cycle length**.
3. Output the **original i, original j, and the maximum cycle length** found in the range.

**Format:**

```
i j max_cycle_length
```

Make sure you **print i and j exactly in the order** they were provided in the input.



## 💡 Example

### Input:

```
1 10
100 200
201 210
900 1000
```

### Output:

```
1 10 20
100 200 125
201 210 89
900 1000 174
```

### Explanation:

* For `1 to 10`, the longest cycle is for `9`, which is `20`.
* For `100 to 200`, the longest cycle length is `125` (for `171`).
* Similarly for the rest.



## 🛠️ Solution Strategy

### Step-by-step:

1. For each number `n` in the range `[min(i, j), max(i, j)]`:

   * Calculate the **cycle length** using the `3n + 1` rule.
2. Track the **maximum cycle length** in that range.
3. Print the result.
