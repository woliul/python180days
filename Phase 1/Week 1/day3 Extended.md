## **What is a List?**
A **list** is a collection of items that can be changed (mutable). You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.

üìå **Example of a List**:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

üîπ **Key Features of Lists**:
- **Mutable** (can change elements)
- **Ordered** (keeps elements in the same order)
- **Can contain different data types** (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans)
- **Uses square brackets `[]`**

## **What is a Tuple?**
A **tuple** is similar to a list, but it **cannot** be changed (immutable). Once created, you cannot add, remove, or modify elements.

üìå **Example of a Tuple**:
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)  # Output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
```

üîπ **Key Features of Tuples**:
- **Immutable** (cannot change elements)
- **Ordered** (keeps elements in the same order)
- **Can contain different data types**
- **Uses parentheses `()`**

### **Tutorial: How to Use Lists and Tuples?**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a List**
```python
my_list = ["dog", "cat", "fish"]
print(my_list)
```
#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Changing a List**
```python
my_list[1] = "rabbit"
print(my_list)  # Output: ['dog', 'rabbit', 'fish']
```
#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Tuple**
```python
my_tuple = ("red", "blue", "green")
print(my_tuple)
```
#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Trying to Change a Tuple (Will Give an Error)**
```python
my_tuple[1] = "yellow"  # ‚ùå ERROR: Tuples cannot be changed
```

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- Use **lists** when you need to modify data.
- Use **tuples** when you want data to remain constant for safety and speed.

# Extended Examples
Here are some examples and problem-solving scenarios. I'll explain everything in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

## **üîπ 3 Examples Using Lists**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Adding and Removing Elements in a List**
```python
# A list of favorite movies
movies = ["Inception", "Titanic", "Avengers"]

# Adding a new movie
movies.append("Interstellar")

# Removing a movie
movies.remove("Titanic")

print(movies)  # Output: ['Inception', 'Avengers', 'Interstellar']
```
‚úÖ **Lists are great when data changes, like adding or removing movies.**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Updating Elements in a List**
```python
# List of prices of grocery items
prices = [2.99, 5.49, 1.79]

# Updating the price of the second item
prices[1] = 4.99

print(prices)  # Output: [2.99, 4.99, 1.79]
```
‚úÖ **Lists allow updating values, useful for changing prices or any variable data.**

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting a List**
```python
# List of student scores
scores = [85, 92, 78, 90, 88]

# Sorting scores in ascending order
scores.sort()

print(scores)  # Output: [78, 85, 88, 90, 92]
```
‚úÖ **Lists are great for sorting and organizing data that changes, like scores.**

---

## **üîπ 3 Examples Using Tuples**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Storing Permanent Information**
```python
# A tuple with country names
countries = ("USA", "Canada", "Germany")

print(countries)  # Output: ('USA', 'Canada', 'Germany')
```
‚úÖ **Tuples are good for fixed data like country names because they don‚Äôt change.**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Accessing Elements in a Tuple**
```python
# Tuple of RGB color values
color = (255, 0, 0)  # Red color in RGB

# Accessing the first value
print(color[0])  # Output: 255
```
‚úÖ **Tuples help store fixed values like colors in a system where the values don‚Äôt change.**

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Using a Tuple for Coordinates**
```python
# GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
location = (37.7749, -122.4194)

print(f"Latitude: {location[0]}, Longitude: {location[1]}")
```
‚úÖ **Tuples are perfect for locations since they don‚Äôt change once recorded.**

---

## **üîπ 3 Examples Using Both Lists and Tuples Together**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Storing Student Information**
```python
# Tuple for permanent details
student_info = ("John Doe", "2023-05-15", 123456)

# List for changing details
grades = [85, 90, 88]

print(f"Student: {student_info[0]}, ID: {student_info[2]}, Grades: {grades}")
```
‚úÖ **Tuples store permanent info (name, ID, birthdate), while lists store changeable data (grades).**

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Product Inventory**
```python
# Tuple for fixed product details
product = ("Laptop", "Dell XPS 13", 12345)

# List for changing stock quantity in different stores
stock = [10, 5, 12]

print(f"Product: {product[1]}, Stock: {stock}")
```
‚úÖ **Product details remain the same (Tuple), but stock changes (List).**

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Employee Records**
```python
# Tuple for fixed employee details
employee = ("Alice Smith", 101, "HR Department")

# List for tracking work hours per week
work_hours = [40, 42, 38, 41]

print(f"Employee: {employee[0]}, Work Hours: {work_hours}")
```
‚úÖ **Employee details don‚Äôt change (Tuple), but weekly hours do (List).**

---

## **üîπ 3 Problem-Solving Examples Using Both Lists and Tuples**
### **Problem 1: Storing Student Information**
#### **Using a List (for Changeable Data)**
```python
# Student information stored in a list
student = ["John Doe", "2023-05-15", 123456, [85, 90, 88]]

# Updating grades
student[3].append(95)

print(student)  # Output: ['John Doe', '2023-05-15', 123456, [85, 90, 88, 95]]
```
‚úÖ **Used a list because grades can change (adding new scores).**

---

#### **Using a Tuple (for Permanent Data)**
```python
# Student details in a tuple
student_info = ("John Doe", "2023-05-15", 123456)

# Grades in a list
grades = [85, 90, 88]

# Adding a new grade
grades.append(95)

print(f"Student: {student_info[0]}, ID: {student_info[2]}, Grades: {grades}")
```
‚úÖ **Used a tuple for fixed details and a list for changeable grades.**

---

### **Problem 2: Storing Contact Information**
#### **Using a List (for Changeable Data)**
```python
# Contact list with a modifiable phone number
contact = ["Alice", "123-456-7890"]

# Updating phone number
contact[1] = "987-654-3210"

print(contact)  # Output: ['Alice', '987-654-3210']
```
‚úÖ **Phone numbers change, so we use a list.**

---

#### **Using a Tuple (for Fixed Data)**
```python
# Name is fixed, but the phone number is in a list
contact_info = ("Alice",)
phone_numbers = ["123-456-7890"]

# Updating phone number
phone_numbers[0] = "987-654-3210"

print(f"Name: {contact_info[0]}, Phone: {phone_numbers[0]}")
```
‚úÖ **Used a tuple for the name and a list for the phone number, which can change.**

---

### **Problem 3: Storing Event Details**
#### **Using a List (for Changeable Data)**
```python
# Event details in a list
event = ["Tech Conference", "2025-06-10", "New York"]

# Changing event location
event[2] = "San Francisco"

print(event)  # Output: ['Tech Conference', '2025-06-10', 'San Francisco']
```
‚úÖ **Used a list because the location might change.**

---

#### **Using a Tuple (for Fixed Data)**
```python
# Event details in a tuple (fixed) and list (changeable)
event_info = ("Tech Conference", "2025-06-10")
location = ["New York"]

# Changing location
location[0] = "San Francisco"

print(f"Event: {event_info[0]}, Date: {event_info[1]}, Location: {location[0]}")
```
‚úÖ **Used a tuple for event name/date and a list for location (since it can change).**

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Lists** are best for changeable data like grades, stock levels, and contact numbers.
- **Tuples** are best for permanent data like names, IDs, and dates.
- **Mixing both** is useful when you have fixed and changeable data together.

# **Exercises**
Here are some exercises for you to practice lists, tuples, and mixing both. Try to solve them on your own first before checking the hints. üòä

## **üîπ Exercises Using Lists**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Modify a Shopping List**
Create a list of 5 grocery items. Then:
- Add a new item to the list.
- Remove one item from the list.
- Replace one item with something else.
- Print the final list.

üí° **Hint**: Use `.append()`, `.remove()`, and index assignment (`list[index] = new_value`).

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Sort and Find the Maximum Score**
You have a list of scores:
```python
scores = [78, 92, 85, 88, 76, 95, 89]
```
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Find the highest score.
- Print the sorted list and the highest score.

üí° **Hint**: Use `.sort()` and `max()`.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Manage a To-Do List**
- Create an empty list called `tasks`.
- Add three tasks to it.
- Remove the first task after it‚Äôs done.
- Print the updated task list.

üí° **Hint**: Use `.append()`, `.pop(0)`, or `.remove()`.

---

## **üîπ Exercises Using Tuples**
### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Store Personal Information**
Create a tuple with your:
- Name
- Date of birth
- Favorite color

Print each piece of information separately.

üí° **Hint**: Use indexing like `tuple[0]`, `tuple[1]`, etc.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Prevent Data Modification**
Try the following:
- Create a tuple with three country names.
- Try to add a new country to the tuple (what happens?).
- Try to change the second country‚Äôs name (what happens?).
- Explain in a comment why tuples behave this way.

üí° **Hint**: Tuples are immutable (unchangeable), so modifying them will cause an error.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Access Tuple Elements**
Given the tuple:
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "grape", "orange")
```
- Print the first and last fruit.
- Use a loop to print each fruit.
