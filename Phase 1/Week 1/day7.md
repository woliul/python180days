## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Reflection Questions**  

Ask yourself:  
- What topics were **easy** for me?  
- What topics felt **challenging**?  
- Which concepts do I need to **review again**?  
- Did I complete all the practice tasks? If not, why?

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Common Beginner Mistakes & Fixes**  

Here are a few common mistakes and how to fix them:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Forgetting Indentation**  
‚ùå Incorrect:
```python
if age >= 18:
print("You can vote!")  # Missing indentation
```
‚úÖ Correct:
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")  # Indented properly
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Mixing Up `=` and `==`**  
‚ùå Incorrect:
```python
if x = 5:  # This will cause an error
    print("x is 5")
```
‚úÖ Correct:
```python
if x == 5:  # `==` is used for comparison
    print("x is 5")
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Using the Wrong Data Type**  
‚ùå Incorrect:
```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")
if age > 18:  # Error! age is a string
    print("You are an adult.")
```
‚úÖ Correct:
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Convert input to integer
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Review Activity**  
Try answering these without looking back:  

1. What is the difference between a **list** and a **tuple**?  
2. How do you check if a key exists in a dictionary?  
3. What operator would you use to check if two values are equal?  
4. How do you remove an element from a set?  
5. What does the `not` logical operator do?

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps: Improving & Moving Forward**  

### **What Should You Do Next?**  
‚úÖ **Revise topics** that felt challenging.  
‚úÖ **Redo practice exercises** from previous days.  
‚úÖ **Try explaining concepts** to someone else (or write them in a journal).  
‚úÖ **Start experimenting** with small projects, like a **to-do list app** or a **simple calculator**.
