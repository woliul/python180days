# **Day 13: Mini Project Planning – Basic Calculator or Number Guessing Game**  

Today, you’ll start planning and coding a **mini project**! You can choose between:  
1. **A Basic Calculator** 🧮  
2. **A Number Guessing Game** 🎯  

Pick **one** (or do both if you feel confident)! 🚀  

---

## **1️⃣ Project Option 1: Basic Calculator**  
### **Features to Include:**
✅ Perform **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.  
✅ Ask the user for **two numbers** and an **operation**.  
✅ Handle **invalid inputs** (e.g., division by zero).  
✅ Allow the user to **keep calculating** until they choose to exit.  

### **Example Output:**
```
Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): *  
Result: 50  
Do you want to continue? (yes/no): yes  
```

### **Planning Your Code:**
1. Define a **function** for each operation.  
2. Use a **while loop** to keep running the calculator.  
3. Use `input()` to get user input and `if-elif` to choose the operation.  
4. Handle **edge cases**, like division by zero.

## **2️⃣ Project Option 2: Number Guessing Game**  
### **Features to Include:**
✅ The program **chooses a random number** between 1 and 100.  
✅ The user **guesses the number**, and the program gives **hints** (too high/too low).  
✅ The game continues until the user **guesses correctly**.  
✅ Count the **number of attempts**.  

### **Example Output:**
```
Guess the number (1-100): 50  
Too high! Try again.  
Guess the number (1-100): 30  
Too low! Try again.  
Guess the number (1-100): 40  
Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 attempts!  
```

### **Planning Your Code:**
1. Use `random.randint(1, 100)` to **generate a number**.  
2. Use a **while loop** to keep asking for guesses.  
3. Use `if` statements to give hints (**too high/too low**).  
4. Count the number of **attempts**.

## **🛠️ Practice Task**
1. **Write a plan** for the project you choose.  
2. **Start coding the basic structure** (e.g., input handling, loops).  
3. **Test and debug** your program!

## **🔍 Reflection & Questions**  
- How does **breaking problems into functions** make coding easier?  
- What **challenges** did you face while implementing the project?  
- What **extra features** could you add to improve your project?
