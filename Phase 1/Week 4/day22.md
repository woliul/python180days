# **Day 22: Advanced List Operations – Insertion, Deletion, Slicing**

Today, you'll dive into **advanced list operations** in Python. Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures, and mastering their manipulation is key.

## **1️⃣ Advanced List Operations**

- **Insertion:**
  - You can add elements at specific positions in a list using `.insert()`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    fruits.insert(1, 'orange')  # Insert 'orange' at index 1
    print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry']
    ```

- **Deletion:**
  - You can remove elements by index using `.pop()`, or by value using `.remove()`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
    fruits.pop(1)  # Removes 'banana' (index 1)
    print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'orange']
    
    fruits.remove('orange')  # Removes 'orange' by value
    print(fruits)  # ['apple']
    ```

- **Slicing:**
  - Lists in Python are **sliceable**. You can access sublists using slicing notation: `list[start:end]`.
  - Example:
    ```python
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'cherry']
    print(fruits[1:3])  # ['banana', 'orange'] (from index 1 to 2)
    print(fruits[:2])   # ['apple', 'banana'] (first two elements)
    print(fruits[2:])   # ['orange', 'cherry'] (from index 2 to end)
    ```

- **Reversing a List:**
  - Use `.reverse()` to reverse a list in place, or `reversed()` for a new reversed list.
  - Example:
    ```python
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
    fruits.reverse()
    print(fruits)  # ['orange', 'banana', 'apple']
    ```

## **2️⃣ Practice: Manipulate Lists Using Advanced Techniques**

Now it’s time to practice these list operations!

- **Task 1:** Create a list of your favorite fruits. Try inserting, deleting, and slicing elements in different ways.
- **Task 2:** Create a list of numbers and reverse the order using both `.reverse()` and `reversed()`. Then, use slicing to print only the first half of the list.
- **Task 3:** Build a program that takes user input to add and remove items from a list (e.g., a shopping list).

## **Reflection & Questions:**

- **Which list operation did you find most useful or powerful?**
- **What’s the difference between using `.remove()` and `.pop()` for deletion?**
- **How can slicing help with specific data extraction?**
