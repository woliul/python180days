# **Day 70: Reflection (Week 10) - Review Data Handling, APIs, & SQL Usage**

Today is a **reflection day**, where we'll review everything you've learned in Week 10, especially regarding **data handling**, **APIs**, and **SQL**. This is also a time to identify any challenges you've encountered, solidify your understanding, and ensure you're comfortable with all the concepts.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Review: Data Handling, APIs, & SQL**

### **1.1 Handling CSV/Excel Files**
- **Review:** In Day 64, you learned how to read from and write to CSV and Excel files using Python libraries like `pandas`. You gained the ability to load data, manipulate it, and export it back into a file format for future use.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - `pandas.read_csv()`, `pandas.read_excel()` to load data into a DataFrame.
  - `df.to_csv()`, `df.to_excel()` to save data back into files.
  - Data cleaning, filtering, and manipulating with Pandas (e.g., `df.groupby()`, `df.merge()`, `df.pivot()`).
  
### **1.2 Working with APIs**
- **Review:** In Day 65, you explored working with **APIs** by fetching weather data from an external API (OpenWeatherMap). You also learned to manipulate data obtained from APIs and display it in a meaningful way.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **HTTP Requests** with `requests.get()` to interact with APIs.
  - Handling **JSON** data using `.json()` method to parse API responses.
  - **Error handling** and managing **user input** for API queries.
  
### **1.3 SQL Queries**
- **Review:** On Days 66 and 67, you covered **SQL basics** like selecting data, filtering with `WHERE` clauses, and grouping with `GROUP BY` to analyze databases.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Writing basic SQL queries: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
  - Advanced SQL: Using **JOINs**, **aggregates** like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and **filtering** with `WHERE`, `HAVING`.
  - Working with databases (SQLite) and combining SQL with Python (`sqlite3` module).

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways**

Here are the key things you should keep in mind from this week:

### **Data Handling:**
- Being able to read and manipulate data efficiently is a crucial skill. Whether it‚Äôs CSV, Excel, or SQL, you now have the tools to extract, clean, and analyze large datasets.
- Pandas is a powerful library for handling tabular data, and with it, you can perform complex data manipulations with simple methods like `groupby()`, `merge()`, and `pivot()`.

### **APIs:**
- APIs allow you to access external data sources, such as weather data, news, or stock prices.
- You can use APIs to automate data retrieval, fetch real-time information, and integrate external services into your projects.

### **SQL:**
- SQL is indispensable for interacting with relational databases. Knowing how to write **SELECT queries**, perform **JOINS**, and use **aggregates** allows you to retrieve and analyze data efficiently.
- **Normalization** and understanding **primary and foreign keys** are important for maintaining a well-organized database.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Challenges**

### **3.1 Where Did You Face Challenges?**
- Was it more difficult working with **APIs**, particularly with handling **JSON** data and managing the API keys securely?
- Did you struggle with certain SQL queries or **advanced joins**? SQL can be tricky, especially when working with complex queries across multiple tables.

### **3.2 How Did You Overcome These Challenges?**
- Did you rely on tools like **debuggers**, **error logs**, or **print statements** to help you troubleshoot?
- Did you break down complex queries into smaller, manageable parts or use **pseudocode** to plan your logic before writing your code?

### **3.3 What Could You Improve or Refine?**
- Do you feel comfortable with the concepts of **data cleaning** (removing nulls, handling missing values)?
- Do you understand **SQL joins** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT), or do you need to review them further?

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps: Applying Your Skills**

### **4.1 Mini Project: Data Analysis & API Integration**

To consolidate your learning, let's apply what you've learned in a **mini project** that combines everything:

**Project: Sales Analysis with API Integration**

#### Project Description:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for the last 7 days for a city of your choice.
   - Create a CSV file or a database table to store sales data (product, date, price, quantity, region).

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Write a Python program that merges your weather data with your sales data.
   - Perform data analysis to see if there's a correlation between weather conditions and sales (e.g., more sales when it‚Äôs sunny, less on rainy days).
   
3. **SQL:**
   - Store your sales data in an SQLite database.
   - Write SQL queries to find the top-selling product, total sales per region, and customer trends.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Use **matplotlib** or **seaborn** to visualize the relationship between weather and sales (e.g., scatter plot or line graph of sales vs. weather conditions).

#### Why This Project?
This will help you combine:
- **API handling** (weather data).
- **Data analysis** and **data manipulation** with **pandas**.
- **SQL** for storing and querying sales data.
- **Data visualization** to present insights clearly.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Continuing the Journey**

Now that you've reached the end of Week 10, here's how you can proceed:
- **Refine your skills:** Work on more advanced API projects or larger SQL queries.
- **Expand your knowledge:** Explore frameworks like **Flask** or **Django** to learn web development and connect databases to web apps.
- **Build a portfolio:** Start putting together small projects on GitHub to showcase your work.
