# **Day 42: Project Review and Optimization** üîßüöÄ

Today is all about **refining and optimizing** your mini project. You'll go through the code to improve readability, performance, and functionality. Let's review and optimize what we've worked on so far.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Review: Bank Account Simulation**

### **üîπ Improvements for the Bank Account System**
- **Transaction fee customization** for Checking Accounts
- **Interest application** for Savings Accounts
- **Transfer method** to allow money transfers between accounts

Let‚Äôs now optimize by improving readability, adding better error handling, and separating concerns where needed.

### **üî∏ Improving Code Readability and Error Handling:**
#### Refactoring the `withdraw` method in `CheckingAccount`:
```python
class CheckingAccount(BankAccount):
    def __init__(self, account_holder, balance, fee=2.00):
        super().__init__(account_holder, balance)
        self.fee = fee

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        total_amount = amount + self.fee
        if total_amount > self._balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds, including fee.")
        self._balance -= total_amount  # Deduct fee with withdrawal

    def account_type(self):
        return "Checking"
```
- Now, the `withdraw` method raises a **ValueError** if the account doesn‚Äôt have enough funds.
- This improves **error handling** and ensures proper flow when handling withdrawals.

#### Refactoring the `apply_interest` method in `SavingsAccount`:
```python
class SavingsAccount(BankAccount):
    def __init__(self, account_holder, balance, interest_rate=0.03):
        super().__init__(account_holder, balance)
        self.interest_rate = interest_rate

    def apply_interest(self):
        if self._balance > 0:
            interest = self._balance * self.interest_rate
            self._balance += interest
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot apply interest to zero or negative balance.")

    def account_type(self):
        return "Savings"
```
- We add **validation** to ensure **interest is applied only when the balance is positive**.

---

### **üîπ Feature 3: Transfer Funds Between Accounts**
Let‚Äôs add a **transfer method** to facilitate transferring funds between two accounts.

```python
class Bank:
    def __init__(self):
        self.accounts = []

    def add_account(self, account):
        self.accounts.append(account)

    def transfer(self, from_account, to_account, amount):
        try:
            from_account.withdraw(amount)  # Withdraw from sender's account
            to_account.deposit(amount)      # Deposit into recipient's account
            print(f"Transferred ${amount} successfully!")
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
    
    def display_accounts(self):
        for acc in self.accounts:
            print(acc.get_details())
```
- The **`transfer` method** handles withdrawing from one account and depositing into another. It also manages **error handling**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Review: Student Management System**

### **üîπ Improvements for the Student Management System**
- **Attendance tracking**
- **GPA calculation** based on grades
- **Ranking students** by GPA

### **üî∏ Improving Code Readability and Error Handling:**
#### Refactor GPA Calculation:
We will improve the GPA calculation logic to **handle cases where grades may not be added**.
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, student_id):
        self._name = name
        self._student_id = student_id
        self._grades = []
        self._attendance = 0

    def add_grade(self, grade):
        if 0 <= grade <= 100:
            self._grades.append(grade)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Grade must be between 0 and 100")

    def calculate_gpa(self):
        if len(self._grades) == 0:
            return 0.0  # If no grades, return GPA as 0
        return sum(self._grades) / len(self._grades)

    def get_details(self):
        return f"Name: {self._name}, ID: {self._student_id}, GPA: {self.calculate_gpa():.2f}, Attendance: {self._attendance}"
```
- We ensure that **only valid grades** (between 0 and 100) are added, and handle **missing grades** gracefully by returning a GPA of 0.

---

### **üîπ Feature 3: Searching for Students**
You can now **search** for a student by their ID and get their details.

```python
class School:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = []

    def add_student(self, student):
        self.students.append(student)

    def display_students(self):
        sorted_students = sorted(self.students, key=lambda stu: stu.calculate_gpa(), reverse=True)
        for stu in sorted_students:
            print(stu.get_details())

    def find_student_by_id(self, student_id):
        for stu in self.students:
            if stu._student_id == student_id:
                return stu.get_details()
        return "Student not found."
```
- The **`find_student_by_id`** method helps you easily look up students by their **ID**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Extra Optimization: Data Persistence (Optional)**

You can enhance your project by saving and loading data using **file I/O**.

Here‚Äôs how you can **save and load** student data to a file:

```python
import json

def save_students_to_file(students, filename="students.json"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump([student.__dict__ for student in students], f)

def load_students_from_file(filename="students.json"):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            student_dicts = json.load(f)
            return [Student(**student_dict) for student_dict in student_dicts]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return []
```
- This method saves student objects as dictionaries and then loads them back when needed.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection**
- How does the **error handling** enhance the user experience when making withdrawals or transfers?
- Why is **data validation** (e.g., checking grade range) important in real-world applications?
- How can **data persistence** help retain project data between sessions?
