# **Day 47: Combining Multiple Modules in Projects**

Today, we‚Äôll focus on how to combine **multiple modules** in a project. As your code grows larger, organizing it into multiple files (modules) is essential to keep it clean and manageable. By the end of today‚Äôs lesson, you‚Äôll learn how to combine different modules and create a small project that uses them.

---

## **What You‚Äôll Learn:**

### **1. Combining Multiple Modules**
In larger projects, you often need to import and use more than one module. The process is simple: you import multiple modules and call their functions or classes as needed.

#### **Example**:
Let‚Äôs say we have two modules: `math_operations.py` and `greet_user.py`.

- **math_operations.py**: Contains mathematical functions.
- **greet_user.py**: Contains a function to greet a user by name.

---

### **Example: Combining Modules**

**math_operations.py**:
```python
# math_operations.py

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
```

**greet_user.py**:
```python
# greet_user.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**main.py**:
```python
# main.py
import greet_user
import math_operations

# Using functions from greet_user.py
name = "Alice"
print(greet_user.greet(name))  # Output: Hello, Alice!

# Using functions from math_operations.py
print(math_operations.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
print(math_operations.multiply(4, 2))  # Output: 8
```

In this example, we combined two modules (`greet_user.py` and `math_operations.py`) into our `main.py` program. Each module provides useful functionality, and we call the functions as needed in the main script.

### **2. Benefits of Combining Multiple Modules**
- **Code organization**: By separating code into modules, each file can focus on a specific task (e.g., math operations, file handling, etc.).
- **Easier to debug**: If there‚Äôs an issue with one part of the code, you can isolate the problem by checking the relevant module.
- **Reusability**: If you need to use a module's functionality in another project, you can simply import it instead of rewriting the code.

---

## **Practice:**

### **1. Create a small project using multiple modules:**

- **Step 1**: Create a module called `math_operations.py` with functions like `add()`, `subtract()`, and `multiply()`.
- **Step 2**: Create another module called `greet_user.py` with a function that takes a name and returns a greeting.
- **Step 3**: Create a `main.py` file that imports both modules and uses their functions.

---

**Example**:

**math_operations.py**:
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
```

**greet_user.py**:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**main.py**:
```python
import greet_user
import math_operations

# Get user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print(greet_user.greet(name))

# Perform some math operations
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {math_operations.add(num1, num2)}")
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is: {math_operations.multiply(num1, num2)}")
```

---

### **2. Experiment with more complex projects:**
You can expand this practice by creating larger projects. For instance:
- **A small calculator app**: Create different modules for arithmetic operations, user inputs, and results display.
- **A basic to-do list**: Use one module for managing tasks, another for saving/loading tasks to a file, and another for the main app logic.

---

## **Review:**
- Today, you learned how to combine multiple Python modules in a single project.
- You saw how to import functions from multiple files and use them in a larger program.
- Modular programming helps keep your code clean, maintainable, and reusable.
