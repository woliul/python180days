# **Day 61: Consuming APIs Using the `requests` Library**

### **Learning:**

Today, weâ€™re going to focus on consuming APIs using the **`requests`** library in Python. Weâ€™ll build a simple **API consumer** application that makes GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. By doing so, youâ€™ll become comfortable with interacting with APIs in a practical way.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Understanding API Response:**
   - After sending an HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the API will return a **response**. The response can contain the data you requested or a message indicating the status of the request.
   - **Status Code**: The response comes with a status code indicating whether the request was successful or not (e.g., **200 OK**, **404 Not Found**).
   - **Response Content**: The data returned by the API, often in **JSON format**.
   
2. **Using the `requests` Library:**
   The `requests` library allows you to send HTTP requests easily. Weâ€™ve already seen basic usage, but letâ€™s explore more deeply.

#### **GET Request Example:**
A simple GET request fetches data from an API. Let's create a Python script to fetch **user data** from the `jsonplaceholder` API.

```python
import requests

# API endpoint for users
url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"

# Send a GET request
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the response was successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    users = response.json()  # Deserialize the JSON response
    for user in users:
        print(f"Name: {user['name']}, Email: {user['email']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

- **response.json()**: Converts the JSON response into a Python dictionary or list.
- **response.status_code**: Check the HTTP status code to ensure the request was successful.

### **Post Request Example (Creating a New Resource):**

When interacting with APIs, you may need to send data to the server, for example, creating a new resource like a new user. This is where a **POST request** comes in.

Hereâ€™s how you would create a new user by sending a POST request with a JSON payload:

```python
import requests

# API endpoint for creating a user
url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"

# New user data
new_user = {
    "name": "Alice Smith",
    "username": "alicesmith",
    "email": "alice.smith@example.com"
}

# Send a POST request to create a new user
response = requests.post(url, json=new_user)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 201:
    print("New user created successfully!")
    print(response.json())  # Print the details of the created user
else:
    print(f"Failed to create user. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

- **requests.post(url, json=data)**: Sends a POST request with the provided `data` in JSON format.
- **Status Code 201**: The server responds with 201 when the resource is created successfully.

### **PUT Request Example (Updating an Existing Resource):**

To **update** an existing resource, youâ€™ll use the **PUT method**. This method allows you to send updated data to the API, replacing the existing resource.

Hereâ€™s an example where we update a userâ€™s name:

```python
import requests

# API endpoint for updating a user (user with ID 1)
url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1"
updated_user = {
    "name": "John Doe Updated"
}

# Send a PUT request to update the user
response = requests.put(url, json=updated_user)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("User updated successfully!")
    print(response.json())  # Print the updated user details
else:
    print(f"Failed to update user. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

- **requests.put(url, json=data)**: Sends a PUT request to update the resource at the specified URL.
- **Status Code 200**: Indicates the resource was successfully updated.

---

### **DELETE Request Example (Removing a Resource):**

You may need to **delete** a resource using a **DELETE request**. In this example, we'll delete a user:

```python
import requests

# API endpoint for deleting a user (user with ID 1)
url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1"

# Send a DELETE request to remove the user
response = requests.delete(url)

# Check the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("User deleted successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Failed to delete user. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

- **requests.delete(url)**: Sends a DELETE request to remove the resource at the specified URL.
- **Status Code 200**: Indicates the resource was successfully deleted.

---

### **Practice:**

1. **Create a New Post (POST Request):**
   - Use the **POST** method to create a new post (e.g., `"title": "My First Post"`, `"body": "This is my first post!"`).
   - Print the response to verify the post creation.

2. **Update an Existing Post (PUT Request):**
   - Use the **PUT** method to update the title of an existing post (e.g., Post with ID 1).
   - Check the updated post details.

3. **Delete a Post (DELETE Request):**
   - Use the **DELETE** method to delete a post (e.g., Post with ID 2).
   - Ensure the post is successfully deleted.

### **Reflection:**
- How confident do you feel about sending and handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests?
- Have you encountered any errors when interacting with APIs? If so, how did you resolve them?
- Do you have any further questions about handling HTTP requests and responses?

Once you feel comfortable with these operations, youâ€™ll be able to interact with most APIs, create your own projects, and handle various tasks. Let me know if you need further assistance or if youâ€™re ready to move on! ðŸ˜Š
