# **Day 68: Review and Debugging Session for Data Projects**

Today is a **review and debugging day**, where we‚Äôll focus on refining your data projects, solving common issues, and reviewing techniques to troubleshoot and optimize your code.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Reviewing Data Projects**

Let's take a step back and review the data-related projects you've worked on so far. Here are some points to consider as you review your work:

### **1.1 Project Structure**
- **Database Design:** Is your database normalized? Are the tables logically structured?
  - Make sure you separate data into multiple tables where necessary, using foreign keys to establish relationships.
  - Avoid storing repetitive data in one table. For example, instead of storing the same product details in every order, store the product details in a separate `products` table and reference it in the `orders` table using a product ID.

### **1.2 Data Integrity**
- **Consistency:** Have you ensured the consistency of your data? Are there any rows with null or invalid values?
  - Consider using **constraints** such as `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK` when creating tables to enforce data integrity.

  Example of creating a table with constraints:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE products (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      price REAL CHECK (price > 0),
      quantity_in_stock INTEGER CHECK (quantity_in_stock >= 0)
  );
  ```

### **1.3 Code Quality**
- **Clarity:** Is your code clean and easy to understand? Are you using meaningful variable names, and are your functions and methods well-organized?
- **Reusability:** Is your code reusable? Can you extract portions of it into functions or modules that can be reused in other projects?

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Common Debugging Techniques**

In any project, you‚Äôll run into bugs and issues. Here are some common debugging techniques to help you identify and fix problems.

### **2.1 Use of Print Statements**
One of the simplest ways to debug code is by using **print statements**. If your code isn't behaving as expected, insert print statements to check the flow of execution and the values of variables at different points.

Example:
```python
print(f"Product Name: {product_name}, Price: {product_price}")
```

This will give you insights into where the issue might be happening.

### **2.2 Using a Debugger**
Python comes with a built-in debugger called **`pdb`** (Python Debugger), which allows you to set breakpoints and step through your code line by line.

Here‚Äôs how you can use it:

1. Import `pdb` at the top of your script:
   ```python
   import pdb
   ```

2. Add `pdb.set_trace()` where you want to start debugging:
   ```python
   pdb.set_trace()
   ```

When the code execution reaches this point, the program will pause, and you'll enter an interactive debugger session. You can inspect variables, run commands, and step through the code.

### **2.3 Use of Exception Handling**
As discussed before, using **`try-except`** blocks can help identify errors and prevent crashes. To get more detailed information about the error, print the error message:

```python
try:
    # Your code
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This will give you the exact error message, which can be incredibly helpful in identifying what went wrong.

### **2.4 Logging**
Sometimes, you may want to log messages for later inspection, especially in larger projects. The **`logging`** module allows you to log messages at different severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.).

Example:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an info message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
```

You can review logs to track down where things are going wrong, especially in larger applications.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Common Issues and Solutions**

Here are some common problems you may encounter and how to fix them:

### **3.1 SQL Syntax Errors**
- **Issue:** Incorrect SQL syntax.
  - **Solution:** Double-check your SQL queries for typos or missing keywords. Remember, SQL keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` should always be in uppercase.

### **3.2 Missing or Invalid Data**
- **Issue:** The program is inserting invalid or missing data into the database.
  - **Solution:** Add validation before inserting data into the database. Ensure that no `NULL` values are inserted into columns that require data. Use `CHECK` constraints to enforce valid values.

### **3.3 Slow Query Performance**
- **Issue:** Queries are taking too long to execute.
  - **Solution:** Optimize your SQL queries by:
    - Adding **indexes** on frequently queried columns.
    - Using **LIMIT** and **OFFSET** to paginate large results.
    - Avoiding **SELECT *;** and instead selecting only the columns you need.
    - Breaking large queries into smaller ones if needed.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices for Debugging and Review**

Here are some best practices for debugging and reviewing your code and projects:

### **4.1 Keep Track of Changes**
When working on a project, especially as it grows in complexity, it‚Äôs important to **keep track of your changes**. Use a **version control system** like **Git** to keep track of your code changes. This allows you to revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.

### **4.2 Write Unit Tests**
Testing is an essential part of any development process. Writing **unit tests** ensures that your code works as expected and helps catch bugs early on.

For example, if you have a function that calculates the total stock value (price * quantity_in_stock), you can write a test to check if the function works correctly:

```python
import unittest

class TestStockValueCalculation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_stock_value(self):
        self.assertEqual(calculate_stock_value(10, 20), 200)
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### **4.3 Review and Refactor**
Always **review** your code after completing a task or a project. Refactor it to improve readability and performance. Look for areas where you can:
- Optimize loops
- Simplify functions
- Improve variable names

## **üõ†Ô∏è Practice Tasks**

### **Task 1: Debug Your Project**
1. Review your previous projects and check for any areas where the code could be improved or optimized.
2. Add error handling (e.g., try-except blocks) to ensure your program runs smoothly even when things go wrong.
3. Use **print statements** or a **debugger** to find and fix any bugs.

### **Task 2: Refactor Code**
1. Refactor your code for better readability and efficiency. Try using smaller, reusable functions and simplifying complex code.

### **Task 3: Write Unit Tests**
1. Write unit tests for some of your functions to ensure they work correctly.

## **Tips for Success**
- Debugging can be a challenging process, but with patience and the right tools, you can solve any issue.
- Keep your code organized and easy to understand by following best practices and refactoring regularly.
- Unit tests and version control can save you time and effort in the long run.
