| 6  | **Optimize Only After It's Correct**   | First make it work, then make it fast.                                             | Implement straightforward solution ‚Üí Test correctness ‚Üí Profile and optimize bottlenecks                            |
| 7  | **Know Your Tools (STL, libraries)**   | Experts don‚Äôt reinvent sorting, heaps, sets ‚Äî they **use them**.                   | Identify standard data structures/libraries relevant to problem ‚Üí Use them instead of custom code                   |
| 8  | **Code Cleanly & Modularly**           | Easy to debug, test, and change.                                                   | Write functions/modules ‚Üí Use clear variable names ‚Üí Comment tricky parts ‚Üí Keep code readable                      |
| 9  | **Test Edge Cases**                    | 0, 1, max, empty, duplicates, sorted, reverse-sorted.                              | Prepare test suite including edge and corner cases ‚Üí Run all tests regularly                                        |
| 10 | **Practice Regularly, Reflect Deeply** | Solve, but also **review why you were wrong or slow.**                             | After solving, analyze mistakes/difficulties ‚Üí Study faster/better solutions ‚Üí Repeat with similar problems         |

## üîç PART 2: Most Used Problem-Solving Methods (with How to Use Them)

### 1. **Brute Force First**

* **Why it works:** Gives a guaranteed correct solution for small inputs.
* **Use it for:** Validating your idea, building test cases.
* **How to use:**

  1. Identify all possible solutions (even if slow).
  2. Implement naive solution quickly.
  3. Use outputs to verify optimized methods.
* ‚úÖ Good for starting
* ‚ùå Bad for performance on large inputs

---

### 2. **Greedy Algorithms**

* **Idea:** At each step, pick the locally best choice.
* **Best when:** Problem exhibits greedy-choice property.
* **How to use:**

  1. Confirm problem‚Äôs greedy property (e.g., proof or intuition).
  2. Sort or prioritize choices if needed.
  3. Iteratively pick best local option ‚Üí Build solution.
  4. Check if solution is optimal.
* ‚úÖ Fast
* ‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt always give optimal result

---

### 3. **Two Pointers / Sliding Window**

* **When to use:** Arrays, subarrays, substrings with constraints.
* **How to use:**

  1. Initialize two pointers (start/end).
  2. Move one pointer forward while maintaining condition.
  3. Adjust other pointer as needed to keep valid window.
  4. Track max/min values or counts during traversal.
* ‚úÖ O(n) instead of O(n¬≤)

### 4. **Binary Search (on answer)**

* **Use:** When answer lies in a numeric range and predicate is monotonic.
* **How to use:**

  1. Define search range for the answer.
  2. Implement a predicate function that returns true/false.
  3. Binary search over range to find boundary where predicate changes.
* ‚úÖ Fast (O(log range))

---

### 5. **Prefix Sum / Difference Array**
